# üìä Walmart Sales Forecasting
A complete sales analysis & forecasting project using a cleaned Walmart dataset. This repo contains an interactive Excel dashboard (KPIs, Pivot charts, slicers), with EDA and time-series forecasting using Prophet, LSTM, and SARIMAX. Visual outputs from the notebook are included as screenshots to provide actionable business insights.

##  The project includes:
* **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)**: For understanding sales patterns and correlations. 
* **Time-Series Forecasting Models**: Prophet, SARIMAX, and LSTM for future sales prediction.
* **Excel Dashboard**: With KPIs, charts, and slicers for interactive analysis.
Visual Documentation with screenshots of analysis and results.

## üìä Time-series forecasting Insights:
- Long-term trend shows decrease in sales.
- Monthly seasonality: Sales peak around Nov-Dec (holiday season).
- Holiday weeks show clear uplift in average sales.
- Promotions positively correlate with higher weekly sales.
- SARIMAX captured seasonality well; 
- Prophet is interpretable
- LSTM captured complex patterns.

## Interactive Excel dashboard contains:
* Pivot tables & Pivot charts
* **KPI cards** ( Key Performance Indicators)-
1.	Total Sales: ‚Çπ6,73,72,18,987.00 ‚Äì Represents the cumulative sales generated across all stores and departments.
2.	Average Weekly Sales: ‚Çπ15,981.26 ‚Äì Gives an idea of the overall sales consistency per week.
3.	Best Week Sales: ‚Çπ6,93,099.36 ‚Äì The maximum revenue recorded in the best-performing week.
4.	Worst Week Sales: ‚Çπ4,988.94 ‚Äì The lowest revenue recorded in the least-performing week.
5.	Holiday Avg. Sales: ‚Çπ17,035.82 ‚Äì Shows higher average sales during holiday weeks, highlighting holiday demand surges.
6.	Non-Holiday Avg. Sales: ‚Çπ15,901.45 ‚Äì Indicates baseline weekly sales outside holidays.
7.	Top Store by Sales: Store 20 with ‚Çπ30,13,97,792.5 ‚Äì The store contributing the highest sales.
8.	Top Department by Sales: Department 92 ‚Äì The leading department in terms of revenue contribution.
* **Interactive Filters** (Slicers)
The dashboard is fully interactive with slicers for:
1.	Department ‚Äì Enables drilling down into department-level sales.
2.	Store ‚Äì Allows selection of specific store(s) for deeper analysis.
3.	Year (2010, 2011, 2012) ‚Äì Helps in comparing performance trends year-over-year.
4.	Holiday (True/False) ‚Äì Filters sales based on holiday vs. non-holiday weeks.
